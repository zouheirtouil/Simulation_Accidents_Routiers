# Simulation_Accidents_Routiers



According to official figures for 2015, road accidents in Morocco result in more than 4,000 deaths each year, which is an alarming figure.




Faced with this significant human loss, it would be wise to opt for a more effective preventive strategy: simulation.




It is within this framework that I carried out a project in collaboration with M KASSEL ISSAM, EL-HAMDOUNI RADIA and CHEQAOUI JIHANE, supervised by Mrs OUAZZANI TOUHAMI KHADIJA.
This project allowed us to share together reflections, tasks, planning In order to predict indicators to take decisions with the aim of having less than 2000 killed per year in 2026, by passing by the stages of a simulation and especially the stage *Proposal and Validation of the Model* .
For the realisation of this project we have opted for the Python3 and Dash libraries (the framework for web applications in Python).
